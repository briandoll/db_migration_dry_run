DbMigrationDryRun
=================

History
=======
Geoffrey Grosenbach (topfunky) wrote the original "dry run" for migrations:
http://nubyonrails.com/articles/a-dry-run-for-migrations

The code was included in his topfunky_power_tools bundle:
http://topfunky.net/svn/plugins/topfunky_power_tools/

I'm resurrecting this code with an aim to:
 * Add support for Rails 2.x
 * Ensure support for all major database adapters including Oracle
 * Add support for column renaming, etc.


Example
=======

rake db:migrate:dry_run [all standard db:migrate options supported]


Status
======
* Tested against sqlite
* Works for create,add,remove table/column
* Does _not_ work for change_column (yet)
